# Share Tracker

Share Tracker is a single-page Rails + React app I made to act as a client for my URL shortener, Small URL. It includes a rudimentary homebrewed account login system and provides access to all Small URL features, including:

* Creating small URLs

* Viewing the visit count for each URL

* Disabling URLs

* Association of URLs with an owner
