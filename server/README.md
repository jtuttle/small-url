# Small URL - A URL shortener.

Small URL is a standalone API-only Rails app that can be used to generate and visit shortened URLs. Each small URL token is generated by performing a base conversion on a database row ID. See the Apipie docs for further usage information.

## Basic Features

* Maintains a visit count for each URL.

* Optionally specify a UUID to associate a URL with an owner.

* Ability to permanently disable small URLs to prevent further visits.

* Vowels excluded from token alphabet for profanity protection.

* Apipie documentation and parameter validation.

## Security Features

* Verifies long URL format and response before creating a small URL.

* Integration with Google Safe Browsing API for malware protection.

* Salts and encrypts long URLs before inserting into the database for enhanced user privacy.

* Uses UUIDs to reference resources externally.
